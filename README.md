# good-undead-horses
Finally makes undead horses good.

Install this mod like any other, profit.

So far all this mod does is enable you to equip a skeleton horse or zombie horse with horse armor just like normal horses.
No other changes have been made.
This will not break anyone's world, it replaces vanilla mobs and nothing else.
Should work well with other mods that interact with the undead horses so long as they:
-Do not inject into the undead horse mobs like this mod does
-For some reason rely on the fact they cannot wear armor
